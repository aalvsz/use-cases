A face detector and a face blur, end to end. Use the pretrained one or train your own. Both paths run with [LibreYOLO](https://github.com/LibreYOLO/libreyolo) and an RF-DETR Nano backbone.

## Path 1: use it (60 seconds)

```bash
pip install onnxruntime opencv-python huggingface_hub numpy

python -m src.use_pretrained --image my_photo.jpg
# writes my_photo.censored.jpg
```

That's it. The script downloads `face.onnx` from [LibreYOLO/face-rfdetr-nano](https://huggingface.co/LibreYOLO/face-rfdetr-nano) on first run, caches it locally, and runs inference via `onnxruntime`. No torch, no libreyolo, no training stack.

## Path 2: build it (under an hour)

For when you want to learn the pipeline, fine-tune on your own data, or just not trust someone else's weights.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LibreYOLO/use-cases
cd use-cases/censor-faces
pip install -r requirements.txt

python -m src.download_widerface         # ~360 MB, 1-2 min
python -m src.train --epochs 30          # ~30-40 min on MPS / CUDA
python -m src.eval                       # mAP on val
python -m src.censor --image my.jpg      # blur faces with your own weights
```

The defaults reproduce the pretrained release: 80-image WIDERFACE subset, 30 epochs, RF-DETR Nano. Bump `--train-images` and `--epochs` for a stronger model.

## Or run it in Colab

Click the Colab badge above. The notebook runs both paths end-to-end on a free T4 GPU.

## What's where

```
src/
  common.py               shared blur helper (no heavy deps)
  download_widerface.py   build only: dataset acquisition + YOLO conversion
  train.py                build only: RF-DETR Nano fine-tuning loop
  eval.py                 build only: mAP on val split
  censor.py               build only: load .pt weights, detect, blur
  use_pretrained.py       use only: HF download + ONNX inference + blur
  webcam.py               build only: live webcam demo with a trained .pt

Each script is independent. Re-run any one in isolation.

## Honest numbers

The released weights were trained on **80 images for 30 epochs** (the smoke-test config above). Validation AP@0.50 = 0.93 on a 20-image val split. Both numbers are noisy because the splits are tiny.

In practice that's enough to blur most clearly visible faces in well-lit photos. It's not enough for production use against tiny, occluded, or off-angle faces. For that, train on more data:

| `--train-images` | Realistic AP@0.50 | Time on MPS |
|---|---|---|
| 80 (released) | 0.85-0.95 (noisy) | 30-40 min |
| 500 | 0.85-0.90 (stable) | 2-3 hours |
| 2000 | 0.90+ | 8-12 hours |

## Run it in the browser

The same model exports to ONNX and runs client-side via [libreyolo-web](https://github.com/LibreYOLO/libreyolo-web):

```python
from libreyolo import LibreYOLO
LibreYOLO("face.pt", nb_classes=1).export(format="onnx", opset=17)
# writes weights/rfdetr_n.onnx
```

Then in JS, load it via `loadModel('./face.onnx', { modelFamily: 'rfdetr', inputSize: 384 })`. See the [chromium use case](../chromium/) for the page structure to copy from.

## FAQ

**Why RF-DETR Nano?** Transformer detector that learns very fast from few examples (the released weights got AP@0.50 = 0.93 from 150 gradient updates total). 108 MB ONNX, runs on CPU, GPU, or Apple Silicon.

**Can I use my own dataset?** Yes. Put it in Roboflow YOLO layout (`<dir>/train/{images,labels}/`, `<dir>/valid/{images,labels}/`, plus a `data.yaml` with `names`). Then `python -m src.train --data path/to/your/dataset`.

**Why is `rfdetr` pinned to 1.4.1?** libreyolo's wrapper imports `rfdetr.main` which was removed after that version. Pinning is the cleanest workaround until the wrapper updates.

**Does this respect privacy?** This blurs faces in your own data. It is not a face recognition or identification tool.
